My practice website
I'm learning some (very basic) web design as I'm interested in transitioning from tech support to tech writing.
This is my initial attempt at a website, not that pretty but I feel like I'm starting to get the basics of HTML and CSS at least.
I'm also using it to learn how Git and GitHub work, how to version my code, how to create clones and alternative branches, and how to rollboack when things don't work quite the way I planned them.
