    <p>Windows 10 no longer supports setting updates to download but not install, or the option to have them only delivered
        when you manually search for them (at least not easily, there are hacks but they are not recommended for non-technical
        computer users). You can however still adjust some settings, such as active hours, whether you get just Windows updates
        or all Microsoft product updates, or you can force an out of schedule check to see if there are any missing patches.
        Active hours lets you set when you most frequently use your computer so that Windows doesn't schedule a reboot during
        those hours.</p>

    <p>Note that Microsoft currently releases Windows patches as a bundle rather than multiple files like in previous versions.
        At the time of writing, there is no easy way to install a single patch for a specific problem without going through
        various Microsoft troubleshooting channels and their support site. Some urgent patches can be released on a non-standard
        schedule but the majority of non-critical issues are all released in the monthly patch. After installing patches,
        Windows will usually need a reboot to update any files in use. By default it will schedule these automatically, so
        you are best making sure that the active hours setting covers the times you use the machine most. This reduces the
        chances of Windows shutting down and rebooting when you are using the machine and losing anything you're working
        on.</p>

    <p>To check your Windows Update settings:</p>

    <ol class="numbered">
        <li>Click on the Start menu symbol at the bottom left corner of the screen:</li>

        <img src="images/update1.GIF" alt="" title="" />

        <li>In the menu shown, click the Settings icon to the left of the application list:</li>

        <img src="images/update2.GIF" alt="" title="" />

        <li>Click the Update & security tile:</li>

        <img src="images/update3.GIF" alt="" title="" />

        <li>At the top of the Window, you can see when your machine last checked for updates:</li>

        <img src="images/update4.GIF" alt="" title="" />

        <li>Just below that, you can force it to check for Updates from the Microsoft update site, or view what updates have
            been applied to your system:</li>

        <img src="images/update5.GIF" alt="" title="" />

        <li>From the main Windows Update screen, you can also set the hours the machine is likely to be in use (in theory reboots
            and patch installs will be scheduled outside those hours), restart options (depending on other settings these
            may not be available), or Advanced options which allows you to decide if you want updates to other Microsoft
            products, such as Office, at the same time as the Windows Updates (I'd recommend doing this as well, especially
            if you use Microsoft office):</li>
