    <h1>What is a virus?</h1>

    <p>Wikipedia defines computer viruses as "self-replicating computer programs which modify other software without user consent".
        Not all viruses have a destructive purpose, however the majority are designed for malicious purposes, ranging from something as simple as stealing processor time, displaying targeted messages on the infected computer, or spamming email contacts, to the more harmful activities like logging keystrokes to obtain private information or encrypting or corrputing files (often with blackmail in mind to get the files recovered). The key to classing a peiece of software as a virus though is that it does things without the permission of the computer owner, and attempts to copy itself to other computers without any external interaction (meaning your permission to install). Viruses are a form of a larger class of computer software known as malware, but not all malware is a virus. The more general class of malware will be covered under the AntiMalware page.</p>

    <h2>How do you get a computer virus?</h2>

    <p>There are many ways that your computer can be infected by a computer virus. Some are built in to less than reputable software and automatically installed behind the scenes when you chose to install that software. Others can be spread by email, usually requiring you to click a link to something, then installing the virus along with whatever the link points to. Some can be built in to files like Microsoft Word or Excel documents using the macro features of the software, so when you open the file the macro runs automatically and installs the virus onto your machine. And finally some simply sit on an infected machine searching to see if they can see other machines on the network or internet that they can copy themselves across to somehow. However they spread themselves there is usally no indication that the machine has been infected until the virus is triggered, either by its own built in timer or by some action taken by the user of the computer that the virus has been set up to wait for.</p>

    <h2>How do you stop a virus?</h2>

    <p>Like any other form of infection, prevention is better than cure when it comes to computer viruses. Having an up-to-date antivirus software application running on your machine can often find the virus as it attempts to install itself or copy itself onto your machine in the first place. The antivirus software (often referred to as AV) will scan any file you copy, download, or try to open and compare the file to all of the viruses it knows about. The scan is virtually instant as the AV will look for known signatures of various classes of virus, and will only scan in more depth if it finds a match. These signatures are changing constantly which is why you always need the most up-to-date version of the AV software to keep up with the viruses currently out on the internet. If the AV software finds a match, it will usually display a warning that the file is infected, depending on which software and on how it has been setup it will also usually "clean" the file by removing the virus if it can or by deleting the entire file if the virus can't be separated out.</p>
