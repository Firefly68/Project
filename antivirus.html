    <h1>What is a virus?</h1>

    <p>Wikipedia defines computer viruses as "self-replicating computer programs which modify other software without user consent".
        Not all viruses have a destructive purpose, however the majority are designed for malicious purposes, ranging from
        something as simple as stealing processor time, displaying targeted messages on the infected computer, or spamming
        email contacts, to the more harmful activities like logging keystrokes to obtain private information or encrypting
        or corrputing files (often with blackmail in mind to get the files recovered). The key to classing a peiece of software
        as a virus though is that it does things without the permission of the computer owner, and attempts to copy itself
        to other computers without any external interaction (meaning your permission to install). Viruses are a form of a
        larger class of computer software known as malware, but not all malware is a virus. The more general class of malware
        will be covered under the AntiMalware page.</p>

    <h2>How do you get a computer virus?</h2>

    <p>There are many ways that your computer can be infected by a computer virus. Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>they can be built in to less than reputable software and automatically installed behind the scenes when you chose
                to install that software</li>
            <li>they can be spread by email, usually requiring you to click a link to something, then installing the virus along
                with whatever the link points to</li>
            <li>they can be built in to files like Microsoft Word or Excel documents using the macro features of the software,
                so when you open the file the macro runs automatically and installs the virus onto your machine</li>
            <li>they simply sit on an infected machine searching to see if they can see other machines on the network or internet
                that they can copy themselves across to somehow.</li>
        </ul>
        However they spread themselves there is usually no indication that the machine has been infected until the virus is triggered,
        either by its own built in timer or by some action taken by the user of the computer that the virus has been set
        up to wait for.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you stop a virus?</h2>

    <p>Like any other form of infection, prevention is better than cure when it comes to computer viruses. Having an up-to-date
        antivirus software application running on your machine can often find the virus as it attempts to install itself
        or copy itself onto your machine in the first place. The antivirus software (often referred to as AV) will scan any
        file you copy, download, or try to open and compare the file to all of the viruses it knows about. The scan is virtually
        instant as the AV will look for known signatures of various classes of virus, and will only scan in more depth if
        it finds a match. These signatures are changing constantly which is why you always need the most up-to-date version
        of the AV software to keep up with the viruses currently out on the internet. If the antivirus software finds a match, it
        will usually display a warning that the file is infected, depending on which software and on how it has been setup
        it will also usually "clean" the file by removing the virus if it can or by deleting the entire file if the virus
        can't be separated out.</p>

    <h2>What do I do if I think I have a computer virus?</h2>

    <p>If for some reason you think you have a computer virus, the first thing you need to do is run a full anti-virus scan. When you open your anti-virus application, you have the option somewhere in the menus to start a full scan. Set this going and let it run until it's completed. If, at the end of the scan it says it found something, follow it's instructions on how to deal with the problem if necessary, and then run the scan again. Keep repeating that process until the antivirus software doesn't report any problems.</p>
    <p>Another option is to use a machine that you know isn't infected and search the internet for "antivirus boot disk". There are multiple options available, but these allow you to create a CD, DVD or USB stick that you can boot the machine from. This option means it can scan files on your system that would normally be in use, and is a good alterntive if your normal antivirus software isn't able to clean your machine or you are having problems getting Windows to start at all.</p>
