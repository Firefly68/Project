    <h1>What on earth is "phishing"?</h1>
    <p>"Phishing" is an attempt to get sensitive information, like your username, password, credit card details or other critical
        information by contacting you and pretending to be someone else. Typically, the "phishers" pretend to be your bank,
        credit card, utility company or some other company you deal with on a regular basis. The end goal of the communication
        is to get any information they can that will let them hack your accounts, and possibly give them information that
        will hint at other accounts they could potentially access.</p>

    <h2>So how do I spot a "phisher"?</h2>
    <p>The main way to spot a phishing attempt is an unexpected email from a company who you potentially deal with. If your
        utility company emails and says there's a problem with your account, please click this link, it's probably a scam
        or phishing attempt. The same applies to your bank, investment company, pension company, or any other company you
        deal with. Companies these days know that scams are common, so they never send a link saying "please click here to
        check". If they really want to warn you about a possible problem, they more often send an email say "please log on
        to your account (using your usual link) and go to
        <em>this menu item</em> to tell you where to go from your usual logon.</p>

    <h2>Unexpected email</h2>
    <p>So what do you do if you do get an email that looks like it's legitimate? If you do click the link, everything isn't
        lost. The first thing to realise is NEVER EVER EVER enter a username and password if asked when you click a link
        in an email. Any real communication from any legitimate business will never lead to a logon page. If you click a
        link and it asks for a username and password - CLOSE THE TAB NOW!!</p>

    <p>And if it's from someone you know? Same applies. Anything your friends send should NEVER ask for a username and password.
        If it does, it's probably fake. If it seems like something they wouldn't normally send, contact them by some method
        that isn't email - text them, use Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, whatever you have to do to verify the email is genuine
        without without replying to the email.</p>

    <p>As a general rule I'd say never click a link in any email you weren't expecting, regardless of who it looks like the
        sender is. The only links that you know are safe are ones where you've just requested information from a site, like
        a password reset request or product information. At very least, if it's from a family or friends check that they
        sent it deliberately, if it's from a company and you didn't ask for it, don't click.</p>
