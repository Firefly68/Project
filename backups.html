    <h2>Why should I backup my files?</h2>
    <p>A backup of your files is a copy of the files stored somewhere other than your main computer. It is highly recommended
        that you save a copy of your files somewhere else on a regular basis so that if your computer is lost, stolen or
        damaged severely you still have most of your information. For example, if your hard drive fails or is damaged, it may be that you can't get the data from the disk without spending several thousands on a specialist data recovery company (and they won't guarantee anything). If your computer is lost or stolen you won't even have the option of paying to try to get your files back as there isn't a disk available to try to recover from. A copy of the files somewhere else means you haven’t lost everything.</p>

    <h2>How should I backup my files?</h2>
    <p>There are several ways you can create a backup of your files:
        <ol>
            <li>Use a cloud account like Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or DropBox. Some of these services let you have a limited
                amount of space for free, then you can add more for a fee. Others charge you a monthly fee but usually offer
                more storage space.</li>
            <li>Backup or copy your files to a USB storage drive. These are relatively cheap these days, and range in size from
                a couple of gigabytes to over a terabyte. You can pick up larger drives for around $100 that will usually
                easily hold multiple copies of your files.</li>
            <li>A combination of these two methods. This is the option I use myself. I have a Google Drive account that gives
                me 15GB of free storage space. I’ve set this up to automatically keep the cloud version and my desktop versions
                in sync. This is where I keep all of the files I change on a regular basis, the automatic file synchronisation
                of the two means I get a backup when I change a file without actually having to do anything as long as I
                have an internet connection. Files that don’t change regularly, like photos, I copy to a USB drive as often
                as I need to.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <p>I’ll go into detail next about how to create a copy to a USB and how to set up a cloud account on Google or Microsoft.</p> 
    
    <h3>Backing up to USB</h3> 
    <p>A USB drive is a portable hard disk in a case. You can get smaller versions that are easily portable but limited
    in storage space through to larger, less portable versions that are around the same storage space as the average laptop.
    For more permanent backups I would recommend spending the $100-$150 price tag to get tone that holds at least 1TB as
    this will let you backup your entire machine and also give you the option to store multiple versions of your files if
    you like.</p> 
    
    <p>There are two main ways you can use a USB for backing up your machine:</p> 
    
    <ol>
    <li><h4>Windows Backup</h4></li> 
    <p>To backup your entire computer you can use the Backup feature built in to most versions of Windows. This means if anything happens to your
    computer hard drive you can recover the entire windows setup without having to go through the reinstall process for Windows
    and all your software again. Using the Windows Backup tool will also mean that the backup file is smaller than just a
    file copy over, which means you can have several copies as you add and remove software from your machine. This process
    can take several hours though, depending on how much you have stored on your computer. I’d recommend combining this with
    the file copy process for frequently changed files, and just running Windows backup once a year or so to keep the backup
    updated with changes and patches.</p>
    <p>To use Windows Backup:</p> 
    <ol>
    <li>OPen your Start menu and scroll down to Windows System</li>
    <li>Click Control Panel<br />
    <img src="/project/images/control panel.png" alt="Control panel"></li>
    <li>From there, click on Backup&Restore (Windows 7)<br />
        <img src="/project/images/backup&restore.png" alt="Backup and Restore (Windows 7)"></li>
    </ol>
    <li><h4>Copy your files</h4></li> 
    <p>For files you change often, or documents you’ve added since the last backup, the file copy method
    is probably best. Here, you simply copy the main folders like Documents, Photos, Music, etc to the USB drive as is. If
    you want to keep multiple copies (in case you find you deleted something you shouldn’t) you can create a folder on the
    USB drive with the date and copy the folders into that.</p>
