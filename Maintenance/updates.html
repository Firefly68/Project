            <p>Windows 10 no longer supports setting updates to download but not install, or the option to have them only delivered when you manually search for them (at least not easily, there are hacks but they are not recommended for non-technical computer users). You can however still adjust some settings, such as usage times, whether you get just Windows updates ro all Microsoft product updates, or force an out of schedule check to see if there are any missing patches.</p>
        
        <p>Note that Microsft also currently releases Windows patches as a bundle rather than multiple files. As of the time of writing this, there is no easy way to install a single patch for a specific problem without going through various Microsoft troubleshooting channels and their support site. Some urgent patches can be released on a non-standard schedule but the majority of non-critical issues are all released in the monthly patch.</p>
        
        <p>To check your Windows Update settings:</p>
        
        <ol class="numbered">
        <li>Click on the Start menu symbol at the bottom left corner of the screen:</li> 
        
            <img src="/images/update1.GIF" alt="" title="" />
        
        <li>In the menu shown, click the Settings icon to the left of the application list:</li>
        
            <img src="/images/update2.GIF" alt="" title="" />
        
        <li>Click the Update & security tile:</li>
        
            <img src="/images/update3.GIF" alt="" title="" />
        
        <li>At the top of the Window, you can see when your machine last checked for updates:</li>
        
            <img src="/images/update4.GIF" alt="" title="" />
        
        <li>Just below that, you can force it to check for Updates from the Microsoft update site, or view what updates have been applied to your system:</li>
        
            <img src="/images/update5.GIF" alt="" title="" />
        
        <li>From the main Windows Update screen, you can also set the hours the machine is likely to be in use (in theory reboots and patch installs will be scheduled outside those hours), restart options (depending on other sttings these may not be available), or Advanced options which allows you to decide if you want updates to other Microsoft products, such as Office, at the same time as the Windows Updates (I'd recommend doing this as well):</li>
        
            <img src="/images/update6.GIF" alt="" title="" />
            <img src="/images/update9.GIF" alt="" title="" />
         
        </ol>
