    <img class="pull-left" src="/Project/images/folders.png" alt="List of Windows folders" style="margin: 5px 10px 10px 0; border-radius: 5px;">

    <p> When you use Windows, it gives you some standard folders to store your documents and files. These are:
        <ul style="margin-left: 250px;">
            <li>3D Objects (note: this is new in the Creators edition of Windows)</li>
            <li>Desktop</li>
            <li>Downloads</li>
            <li>Documents</li>
            <li>Pictures</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Videos</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>As you can see the suggested use for most of these is obvious. Documents holds general documents, Music has your music files,
    Videos stores video files, etc. The Desktop folder is what you see on your main screen when you log in to Windows. You
    can use this for file storage, but it’s recommended you limit the number of files you store here. Your view can begin
    to get very cluttered if you store a lot in the Desktop folder. If you really want to use Desktop for storage, I recommend
    you limit it to files you’re working on and move them to one of the other folders when you’ve finished with them.</p>
    
    <p>You can think of these folders as drawers in a file cabinet. Each “drawer” has been given a topic like Photos or Documents.
    These are the top level “containers” that describe the type of content in the drawer.</p>
    
    <h2>Sub-Folders</h2> 
    <p>Let’s take the Documents folder as an example. If you only have a few files it’s fairly easy to find what you’re looking for. However, as you create and save files, it can become harder to find the right information. To reduce confusion, you can use filenames
    and sub-folders to organize things and make it easier to see what’s in there.</p>
        
    <p>Using our filing cabinet example, sub-folders are the hanging files inside each drawer. You can use these to divide the contents into more specific types. For example, in Documents you could have folders that say whether they are for work, household, travel and so on. This makes it a lot easier to go directly to that folder to look for what you need. You can also create more folders within these folders.
    Using our example in Documents, if you created a folder called Household, you could split that further into Receipts, Insurance, Utilities and so on. Think about the categories you’re likely to use and create folders that fit those categories.</p>
    
    <p>Try not to overcomplicate things too much. Think about the number of documents you are likely to need in that category
    to consider whether to split it further. If you have a folder called Insurance, you may want to split further into car,
    travel and home. If you go any further than that you aren’t likely to end up with more than one or two documents in each
    – do you really need that level of filing? Instead, use file names to show whose car insurance or which trip the files
    belong to. If it’s a small family and you don’t travel a lot, the home, car and travel folders may not even be worth
    it, just use file names to say who, what and why.</p> 
    
    <h2>File Names</h2>
    <p>When you create a new file, at some point you’ll need to save it. The first time you save it you’ll be asked to give it a name. The more descriptive the name, the easier you’ll find it again later. There are limitations on what you can name files though. The following characters can’t be used in file names:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>< (less than)</li>
        <li>> (greater than)</li>
        <li>: (colon)</li>
        <li>" (double quote)</li>        
        <li>/ (forward slash)</li>        
        <li>\ (backslash)</li>
        <li>| (vertical bar or pipe)</li>
        <li>? (question mark)</li>
        <li>* (asterisk)</li>
        </ul>   
    
    <p>The full length of the file path (see Glossary), including the name and file extension (see Glossary) of the file, has a limit of 260 characters. This means you should stick with a few words to describe your files rather than entire sentences. Some programs suggest names for you based on the first part of the content they see. Microsoft Word will use the first few words or characters in the file to suggest a name. You don’t have to use the suggestion if it doesn’t work to describe the contents properly, just delete what it suggests and type your own name. Other programs may have a naming convention they use by default. Tax software, for example will tend to use the name on the tax return you’ve created plus the year you’re filing.</p>
