    <h1>How NOT to set a Password</h1>
    <p>I know, everyone hates setting passwords, even me. When I get to yet another site that asks me to create a username and
        password I'm tempted to either back away and forget what I was trying to do, or to reuse the same username and password
        combination from somewhere else. While backing away won't hurt me, reusing the same username and password for multiple
        sites isn't a great idea, even though most of us at some point do exactly that. And despite the fact that almost
        everyone laughs at the thought of using something like "password", "12345678", "qwerty" or "123123", year after year
        these still come out as some of the most commonly used passwords (data gathered through the passwords compiled from
        data breaches at big companies or hacked password lists found on the internet).So if you are using any of these as
        a password to any site you actually want to keep secured and private, bear in mind that if someone manages to find
        out your username somehow, if you are using one of these passwords a hacker could guess your password with very few
        attempts.</p>

    <h2>So what should you do instead</h2>
    <p>If you have a lot of online accounts, I'd recommend getting a password manager. You can get either a program you install
        onto your local machine, or one that stores your passwords in a secure website so you can access them from anywhere.
        I use KeePass myself, but LifeHacker has a list of the 5 favourites nominated by their readers in Aug 2017 here
        <a
            href="https://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers">5 Best Password Managers</a>. Many password managers allow you to change passwords for sites through them, access
            passwords on more than one device, have the option for them to generate passwords for you, and to copy and paste
            existing passwords into password fields without having to type them in manually.</p>

    <p>If a password manager isn't for you then there are several ways you can help keep yourself secure:
        <ul>
            <li>NEVER give your password to anyone, including the bank/website/program provider that the password opens.
                <p>A legit bank will never ask you to give your online banking password whether by phone or by email. That's
                    the same for any website or program who asks you to set up a username and password to access their services.
                    At most, they may ask you to go to their website and type it in as you normally would, or request a password
                    reset through a link there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>You can create what's called a "throwaway" account for sites that you aren't too bothered about keeping access
                to
                <p>Sometimes, you are trying to get to a coupon, offer, or some other web page that you may never want to access
                    again. This would be the only instance I can agree with doing what we discussed above and using the same
                    username and password combination for multiple sites. I actually have a separate email address for this
                    kind of site as well (you can create multiple free email addresses through Gmail or Hotmail), so in effect
                    I have a username and password that I never use for any site I know I want to access multiple times,
                    and an email address for resgitering for that "one off" freebie or offer that I know I probably won't
                    stick with. This way my normal email doesn't get cluttered up with all the junk those types of sites
                    keep sending once you've registered, I get the one item I'll probably ever want from them, and my username
                    and password for sites that need to be secure stay far away from the junk sites.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Use a third party login
                <p>Lots of sites now allow you to login using your Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn accounts. While this does mean
                    they get access to some of your personal data (usually at least your public profile on whatever social
                    media) it does also mean that you don't have a separate account for those sites. If anything ever happens,
                    you get to change one password and be able to regain control over the multiple sites that use that account
                    for access. This one depends on how much you value your privacy and data, some of those sites will require
                    more access than just your public profile, so make sure you know what they are able to access and be
                    sure you're comfortable with that first.</p>
            </li>
            <li>For banking and critical sites, create a secure password!
                <p>We got to the part everyone hates, creating a secure password. I know having multiple passwords is a pain
                    to remember (which is why I recommend the password manager), and I know creating a truly secure password
                    is even worse. But think of it this way, carrying your keys around can be a pain sometimes, but would
                    you be happy leaving the house each morning and leaving the door unlocked if you lived in a high crime
                    area? As much as we hate the idea, the internet is now a high crime area, and there are people on every
                    corner just waiting for the day you leave the door unlocked, or even a window they could use to get in
                    - they'll take any chance they can get.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>So what's a "secure" password?</h2>
    <p>A secure password at the basic level is one that isn't easily guessed or cracked. This means a combination of letters,
        numbers and symbols, a minimum of 6 to 8 characters, and no recognisable words. Definitely don't use the name of
        your child or pet along with a birth date, anniversary, or year of birth. A good, secure password could be created
        from a sentence, for example "I live at number 389 Whitehouse Road in the yellow and white house" could give you
        a password of "Ilan389WRityawh". Passwords like that probably wouldn't be cracked by a password cracking tool as
        there's no dictionary reference (the easiest ones to guess are dictionary words, even those with replacements by
        numbers and/or symbols. Another method, which I don't find as easy to remember, is to use a passphrase instead of
        a password and use four random words. This means your passphrase could be "phone picture window sofa". I'd suggest
        if you do that, use something you can see from the place you normally use the computer (hence the exmaple here).
        Because they are a lot longer and the words aren't connected, passphrases are harder to crack.</p>

    <p>A secure password should always be used for sites that need high security, such as your banking sites. Never use the
        same password for more than one of these sites, the last thing you want is for something to happen at one bank (everyone
        is at risk of getting hacked, even banks!) and find that someone managed to get into all of your other banking sites
        because you used the same "secure" password for them all.</p>
