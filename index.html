    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Computers are everywhere these days, and almost vital to every day life. While some people manage to figure out at least
        the basics of how to work with them, there are still many people who are challenged by the seeming complexity of
        using and maintaining their computer in a reasonable working order. These pages are meant for those people and will
        take you through what needs to be done to maintain your computer, keep yourself secure, and perform the common tasks
        that people use computers for.</p>

    <p>I'll walk you through how to maintain your system to stop it slowing down drastically, how to set and
        manage secure passwords, and how to keep yourself as safe as possible while using your computer. I'll also cover
        how to find free training courses to improve your skills, where to find free alternatives to commonly used software
        (so you don't have to pay a fortune to do what you need to) and some basic troubleshooting
        tips and where to find help if those don't work.</p>

    <p>Note: these guides are written for Microsoft Windows 10 as this is currently the most popular operating system for
        sale in the home computer market. The majority of the advice is relevant to all computers though, other versions
        of Windows may look slightly different as you try to follow the steps and some of the menu propmts have changed,
        but the basic principles are there. I should also point out that the advice applies whether
        you use the Windows operating system or not, no operating system is immune to malware, they all need regular maintenance
        to function at their best, and you need software to perform the tasks most people want to use them for. So while
        the steps you take to complete the tasks may differ, they can be taken as a reasonable checklist for
        any computer. If you don't know how to perform these steps on your own operating system, there's often someone in
        your network of friends and family who could help you figure it out, or there are many sources of information on
        the internet. Just search for the task plus the operating system you have to get further advice.</p>
