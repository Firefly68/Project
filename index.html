    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Computers are everywhere these days, and almost vital to every day life. While some people manage to figure out at least
        the basics of how to work with them, there are still many people who are challenged by the seeming complexity of
        using and maintaining their computer in a reasonable working order. These pages are meant for those people and will
        take you through what needs to be done to maintain your computer, keep yourself secure, and perform the common tasks
        that people use computers for.</p>

    <p>On these pages I'll walk you through how to maintain your system to stop it slowing down drastically, how to set and
        manage secure passwords, and how to keep yourself as safe as possible while using your computer. I'll also cover
        how to find free training courses to improve your skills, where to find free alternatives to commonly used software
        (so you don't have to pay a fortune to use your computer for what you need it for) and some basic troubleshooting
        tips (and where to find help if those don't work).</p>

    <p>As I work through these topics I'll also try to cover some of the terminology associated with that section, what the
        terms mean and how they relate. For example, most people have heard of antivirus software and the fact they should
        really run it on their computers, but did you know that's only one form of a whole class of things known as malware?
        Each type of malware can affect your computer differently and pose different risks, from relatively minor to potentially
        catastrophic. As well as covering what you need to do in each section when relevant I'll make sure you know why it
        needs to be done, how often it needs to be done, and what the risks are if you don't do it.</p>

    <p>Note that these guides are written for Microsoft Windows 10 as this is currently the most popular operating system for
        sale in the home computer market. The majority of the advice is relevant to all computers though, other versions
        of Windows may look slightly different as you try to follow the steps and some of the menu propmts have changed,
        but the basic principles are there. It should also be noted that much of the advice does apply regardless of whether
        you use the Windows operating system or not, no operating system is immune to malware, they all need regular maintenance
        to function at their best, and you need software to perform the tasks most people want to use them for. So while the steps you take to complete the tasks detailed here may differ, they can be taken as a reasonable checklist for any computer. If you don't know how to perform these steps on your own operating system, there's often someone in your network of friends and family who could help you figure it out, or there are many sources of information on the internet, just search for the task plus the operating system you have to get further advice.</p>
