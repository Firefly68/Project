    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>"Can I ask you a silly question please?"</p>
    <p>As a someone working in technical support I've lost track of the number of times someone has wandering over to me and
        said almost those exact words. Almost everyone uses computers on a daily basis, either at work or at home, yet there
        are still so many things they don't know about them. A computer is a tool, a convenience, and sometimes a curse,
        in the same way as our cars, electronics, appliances and heating systems are these days. We take all these things
        for granted, most of the time they run fine, and when they don't we call an appliance repair specialist, a car mechanic,
        or a computer technician (in this case, me).</p>

    <p>There are things you can do with your computer though that will help keep it in good working order for longer, and to
        protect yourself (and your computer) from some of the risks out there. In the same way you'd service your car regularly,
        you can run your computer through regular servicing to reduce the chances of something expensive going wrong later.
        On these pages, I'll walk you through how to maintain your system to stop it slowing down, how to set and manage
        secure passwords, and how to keep yourself as safe as possible while using your computer (especially on the internet).
        I'll also cover how to find free training courses to improve your skills, where to find free alternatives to commonly
        used software (so you don't have to pay a fortune to do what you need to) and some basic troubleshooting tips and
        where to find help if those don't work.</p>

    <p>I've tried to split the information into sections that make sense, but you should be aware that there's overlap in many
        topics. For example, antivirus and antimalware are almost the same thing, but malware is a wider topic while viruses
        are better known, so I split them into two topics. I could have also put those under Computer Maintenance as the
        point is to prevent getting malware rather than what to do when you do get it, so it is more maintenance than cure.
        That being said, it's also part of keeping your computer secure, so it made sense to put it under that topic (to
        me anyway). If you don't see what you're looking for under the section you thought it would be, take a quick look
        at the other dropdowns in case it's a crossover topic and I put it somewhere you didn't necessarily think of first.</p>

    <p>Note: these guides are written for Microsoft Windows 10 as this is currently the most popular operating system for sale
        in the home computer market (and the one I can get screenshots for). The majority of the advice is relevant to all
        computers though, other versions of Windows may look slightly different as you try to follow the steps and some of
        the menu prompts have changed, but the basic principles are there. I should also point out that the advice applies
        whether you use the Windows operating system or not, no operating system is immune to malware, they all need regular
        maintenance to function at their best, and you need software to perform the tasks most people want to use them for.
        So while the steps you take to complete the tasks may differ, they can be taken as a reasonable checklist for any
        computer. If you don't know how to perform these steps on your own operating system, there's often someone in your
        network of friends and family who could help you figure it out, or there are many sources of information on the internet.
        Just search for the task plus the operating system you have to get further advice.</p>
