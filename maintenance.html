    <p>PCs need regular maintenance to keep them performing at peak just like your vehicle does. This section of the site will
        show you how to keep your system running, the recommendations for storing your files, and to keep the rubbish from
        cluttering up your machine and getting in the way. It also explains why backing up your files is a good idea and
        suggests various ways to do this so your photos and documents are safe if anything happens to your PC. If you maintain
        your computer using these techniques you'll prevent slowdowns and crashes over time, and get a longer life span from
        the computer.
    </p>

    <p>PC Maintenance also includes keeping the actual laptop or desktop equipment in good condition. You can buy compressed
        air cans to use to help remove dust from the inside of the case, screen wipes to keep the screen clean, and wipes
        to clean the keyboard. The compressed air should be used to blow out any vents in the computer case, especially those
        near the cooling fans. You can also use them to remove small particles from your keyboard, you'll be amazed at how
        much dust and crumbs are removed when you do this.
    </p>

    <p>So in summary, computer maintenance consists of:
        <ul>
            <li>keeping your physical system clean and as dust free as possible</li>
            <li>removing files you no longer need</li>
            <li>storing your data so that both you and the system can find it effectively</li>
            <li>making sure your data is backed up in case your computer is lost, stolen or damaged beyond repair</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
